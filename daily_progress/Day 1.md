## Detailed Learnings  

### Chess Piece Movements  

- **King:** Moves exactly one square in any direction (vertical, horizontal, diagonal). Protecting the king is essential to avoid checkmate.  
- **Queen:** The most powerful piece on the board. Moves any number of squares vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, combining the power of rook and bishop.  
- **Rook:** Moves any number of squares vertically or horizontally. Key piece for controlling open files and supporting castling.  
- **Bishop:** Moves diagonally any number of squares. Effective when paired to control both color complexes.  
- **Knight:** Moves in an “L” shape: two squares along one axis and then one square perpendicular. Unique because it can jump over other pieces.  
- **Pawn:** Moves forward one square, but two squares on its very first move. Captures diagonally, and can promote to any other piece upon reaching the farthest rank.

## Key Tactics and Concepts  

- **Castling:** A special defensive move involving the king and a rook. It helps safeguard the king by moving it towards a corner and activates the rook for play.  
- **Check:** A condition where the king is under immediate threat of capture and must be addressed.  
- **Checkmate:** A game-ending scenario where the king is under threat with no legal moves to escape.
